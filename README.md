# Cycle - iOS (Swift)
#####Created by Adams Ombogna, Jevin Sindu, Caitlyn Chen and Sara Subbannna.

An app that allows bikers to discover the nearest bike racks, discover nearby trails, and pin the location for where they left their bike. 

*Disclaimer: This app was written by 4 students during a hackathon (#AH8) and is being open sourced to showcase what we made how we used different technologies to do that. The code written is not the cleanest nor does it follow common style or standards. Feel free to make a fork of this project and change it as you see fit.*


Cycle is an app created during AngelHacks Hackathon (#AH8) by 4 MakeSchool Summer Academy Students. The app is written completely in swift and makes use of [SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking-Public-/w969-5mn4) on bicycle racks within the city to plot the various points on the map. We used the Cloudant database from the [IBM BlueMix Platorm](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) to easily store this data and created a REST API that we could easily call from within the app.
