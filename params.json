The code written is not the cleanest nor does it follow common style or standards. Feel free to make a fork of this project and change it as you see fit.*\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCycle is an app created during AngelHacks Hackathon (#AH8) by 4 MakeSchool Summer Academy Students. The app is written completely in swift and makes use of [SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking-Public-/w969-5mn4) on bicycle racks within the city to plot the various points on the map. We used the Cloudant database from the [IBM BlueMix Platform](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) to easily store this data and created a REST API that we could easily call from within the app.\r\n\r\n### Attributions\r\nCycle Icon made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com) from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com) under [Creative Commons 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\r\n\r\nTab-bar icons and button images found from [icons8.com](https://icons8.com/web-app/for/ios7/public)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n[Home Page](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.16%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.16%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n[Trails](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.38%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.38%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n[Citi Bike-Share](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.53%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.53%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n[Potential-Login Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.30.30%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.30.30%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 (Adams Ombonga, Jevin Sindu, Caitlyn Chen and Sara Subbannna)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
