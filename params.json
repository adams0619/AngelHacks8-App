The code written is not the cleanest nor does it follow common style or standards. Feel free to make a fork of this project and change it as you see fit.*\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCycle is an app created during AngelHacks Hackathon (#AH8) by 4 MakeSchool Summer Academy Students. The app is written completely in swift and makes use of [SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking-Public-/w969-5mn4) on bicycle racks within the city to plot the various points on the map. We used the Cloudant database from the [IBM BlueMix Platform](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) to easily store this data and created a REST API that we could easily call from within the app.\r\n\r\n### Attributions\r\nCycle Icon made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com) from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com) under [Creative Commons 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\r\n\r\nTab-bar icons and button images found from [icons8.com](https://icons8.com/web-app/for/ios7/public)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n[Home Page](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.16%20PM.png)![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.16%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n[Trails](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.38%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.38%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n[Citi Bike-Share](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.53%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.53%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n[Potential-Login Screen](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.53%20PM.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/adams0619/AngelHacks8-App/blob/master/AngelHacksCaitlyn/AngelHacksCaitlyn/Screenshots/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Jul%2021%2C%202015%2C%202.00.53%20PM.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
